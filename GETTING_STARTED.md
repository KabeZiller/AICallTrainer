# Getting Started with AI Call Trainer

This guide will help you get the application running on your local machine in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- âœ… Python 3.10 or higher
- âœ… Node.js 18 or higher
- âœ… PostgreSQL 15 or higher
- âœ… OpenAI API key with credits
- âœ… Git

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-call-trainer.git
cd ai-call-trainer
```

## Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Database

### Option A: Local PostgreSQL

1. Create a new database:
```bash
createdb ai_call_trainer
```

2. Note your connection string:
```
postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/ai_call_trainer
```

### Option B: Railway PostgreSQL (Recommended for quick start)

1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project â†’ Add PostgreSQL
3. Copy the DATABASE_URL from the dashboard

## Step 3: Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Now edit `backend/.env` with your credentials:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ai_call_trainer
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-here  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Generate a JWT secret:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Step 4: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Still in backend directory
alembic upgrade head
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade -> abc123, Initial migration
```

## Step 5: Start the Backend

```bash
python run.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**âœ… Backend is now running at http://localhost:8000**

Test it: Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to see the API documentation

## Step 6: Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal window** (keep backend running).

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `frontend/.env`:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Step 7: Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v5.4.9  ready in 500 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
```

**âœ… Frontend is now running at http://localhost:5173**

## Step 8: Create Your First Account

1. Visit http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Register"
3. Enter your email and password
4. You'll be automatically logged in

## Step 9: Create an Admin Account (Optional)

To upload scripts, you need an admin account.

**Option 1: Via PostgreSQL**
```bash
# Connect to your database
psql ai_call_trainer

# Update a user to admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

**Option 2: Modify the code temporarily**

In `backend/app/api/auth.py`, line 26, change:
```python
role=user_data.role  # Change to: role="admin"
```

Register a new account, then change it back.

## Step 10: Upload Your First Script

1. Login with admin account
2. Click "Manage Scripts"
3. Enter a script title: "SaaS Cold Call"
4. Paste a cold call script, for example:

```
Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company].

I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time? Great!

The reason I'm calling is that we help companies like [Their Company] 
increase sales productivity by 40% through our AI-powered CRM platform.

I noticed on LinkedIn that you're the [Title] at [Company]. 
Are you currently using any CRM tools for your sales team?

[Wait for response]

I'd love to show you how we've helped companies similar to yours 
cut their sales cycle time in half. Would you have 15 minutes 
this week for a quick demo?
```

5. Click "Create Script"
6. Wait ~10 seconds for AI to generate personas
7. Go back to Dashboard - you should see your script with 3 personas!

## Step 11: Make Your First Practice Call

1. Click "Start Practice Call" on your script
2. Select a persona (try "Easy" first)
3. Click "Start Call" 
4. **Grant microphone permissions** when prompted
5. Start talking through your pitch!
6. Click "End Call" when done
7. Review your detailed feedback

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Your AI Call Trainer is now fully operational!

## Quick Reference

### Start Development (After Initial Setup)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python run.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Stop Servers

- Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal

### Reset Database

```bash
cd backend
alembic downgrade base
alembic upgrade head
```

## Common Issues

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
- Make sure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### "Connection refused" to database
- Check PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
- Verify DATABASE_URL in .env

### "Unauthorized" errors
- Check OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly
- Verify your OpenAI account has credits

### Microphone not working
- Check browser permissions
- Use Chrome or Edge (best WebRTC support)
- Ensure localhost is allowed to access microphone

### Personas not generating
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify OpenAI API key
- May take 10-30 seconds for first generation

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Invite team members to register
2. âœ… Create multiple scripts for different scenarios
3. âœ… Practice with Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard personas
4. âœ… Check the leaderboard to track progress
5. âœ… Review achievements as you improve
